# Project Euler Q Edition

This is my project to solve the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) using Python. It includes solutions to individual problems and a common code base which deals with profiling (to determine the performance of the solutions) and maths functions to do with integers, prime numbers and factorisation.

Currently, I have completed about 10% of the problems.

And remember, it is no fun if you use this to cheat...

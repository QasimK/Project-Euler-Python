Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n
(numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are
an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;
therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284
are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

I will simply loop through all numbers from 1-9999 (x)
1) See if x is not in the list of numbers to ignore
2) Find factors of x
   (Exclude x from this list of factors)
3) Sum of factors = y
4) See y < 10,000
5) Find factors of y
6) See if (sum of factors of y) = x
   (and y != x)
7) If yes then x, y are an amicable pair
8) Add y to the list of numbers to ignore
   (y is necessarily larger than x)

Possible optimisation:
If x is odd then y must be odd because odd X odd = odd (only way to make odd)
therefore, factors of x are all odd.
Sum of pairs of odd make an even, but you exclude the original number
therefore sum of factors of x are odd (=y)
